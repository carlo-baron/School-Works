# Overview  
This repository contains selected college activities. Iâ€™ve only included a few since some activities were too short to be worth adding.  

## Activities Description  

### HCI_BARON_PE.py  
ðŸ“… **3/26/2025:** Initially, this was a simple display designed to practice basic Tkinter widgets (also part of a prelim exam). Later, we were tasked with adding functionalities such as buttons and text (WIP).

### Final Notes  
I chose not to add images because adjusting sizes is too much of a hassle.
